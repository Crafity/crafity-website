# Crafity Design System

**Built with passion**

Our design system uses a terminal-inspired aesthetic with a focus on clarity, performance, and developer experience. Every component is built with semantic HTML, accessibility in mind, and full TypeScript support.

## Design Principles

### 1. Terminal Aesthetic
Monospace fonts, command-line inspired interactions, and a minimalist color palette create a developer-focused experience.

### 2. Accessibility First
All components are built with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in mind. Semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation are standard.

### 3. Token-Based Design
All styling values (colors, spacing, typography) are defined as CSS custom properties for consistency and easy theming.

### 4. Mobile-First Responsive
Components are designed mobile-first with breakpoints at:
- **sm**: 414px (mobile)
- **md**: 1024px (tablet)
- **lg**: 1440px (desktop)

## Design Tokens

Our design system is built on a comprehensive token system:

- **[Colors](/story/style-guide-colors--docs)** - Backgrounds, text, accents, borders, and terminal colors
- **[Typography](/story/style-guide-typography--docs)** - Font families, sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing
- **[Spacing](/story/style-guide-spacing--docs)** - Consistent spacing scale from 2px to 384px

## Components

### Layout
Foundation components that define page structure:
- **Header** - Site navigation and branding
- **Footer** - Site footer with contact info
- **SectionContainer** - Content wrapper with max-width

### Common
Reusable UI components:
- **Button** - Interactive buttons and links
- **Stat** - Statistics display
- **TerminalWindow** - Terminal-styled container
- **ThemeToggle** - Dark/Light/System theme switcher

### Home
Domain-specific components for the homepage:
- **Hero** - Hero section with terminal and stats
- **Services** - Service cards with diagonal accents
- **Approach** - Approach cards
- **CTA** - Call-to-action section

## Theme Support

The design system supports three theme modes:
- **Dark** (default) - Dark backgrounds with high contrast
- **Light** - Light backgrounds for accessibility
- **System** - Follows OS preference

Use the theme toggle in the Storybook toolbar to preview components in different themes.

## Accessibility

All components are tested with:
- **@storybook/addon-a11y** - Automated WCAG compliance checks
- **Keyboard navigation** - Full keyboard support
- **Screen readers** - Proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Color contrast** - WCAG AA compliant color combinations

## Technology Stack

- **React 19.2.0** - UI library
- **TanStack Start** - Meta-framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **CSS Modules** - Scoped styling
- **PostCSS** - CSS processing with nesting and custom media queries
