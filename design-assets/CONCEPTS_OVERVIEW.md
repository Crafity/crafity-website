## Next Steps

1. **Review all concepts** - open the SVG files in your browser or design tool
2. **Test at different sizes** - especially look at the square versions small (favicon size)
3. **Consider your brand personality** - which pattern best represents Crafity?
4. **Feedback**:
   - Which concept(s) resonate most?
   - Any elements you'd like combined?
   - Should I adjust dot density, spacing, or colors?
   - Any concepts to eliminate entirely?

Once you choose a direction, I'll:
- Refine the chosen concept
- Create all necessary variants (light theme, sizes, formats)
- Suggest subtle website design refinements to unify the aesthetics
- Provide implementation files and guidelines
